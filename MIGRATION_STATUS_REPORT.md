1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to your project: `gqdbmvtgychgwztlbaus`
3. Go to SQL Editor
4. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
5. Execute the migration
6. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql`
7. Execute the RLS policies

### Option 2: CLI with Correct Permissions
1. Ensure you have owner/admin access to the Supabase project
2. Run: `npx supabase link --project-ref gqdbmvtgychgwztlbaus`
3. Run: `npx supabase db push`

### Option 3: Direct Database Connection
1. Use the provided PostgreSQL migration script
2. Ensure correct database credentials
3. Run: `node run-pg-migrations.js`

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After successful migration, verify:

1. **Table Creation**
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' ORDER BY table_name;
   ```

2. **Extensions Enabled**
   ```sql
   SELECT extname FROM pg_extension;
   ```

3. **RLS Policies Active**
   ```sql
   SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname 
   FROM pg_policies ORDER BY tablename;
   ```

4. **Vector Functions Available**
   ```sql
   SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
   WHERE routine_name LIKE 'match_knowledge%';
   ```

## 📊 Database Schema Summary

# 🔐 Clerk Authentication Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Clerk authentication for FlashAudit in just a few minutes.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- A Clerk account (free tier available)
- Node.js and npm installed
- FlashAudit frontend running

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Clerk Account
1. Go to [https://dashboard.clerk.com/](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Create Application
1. Click "Create Application"
2. Choose a name: `FlashAudit` or similar
3. Select authentication methods you want:
   - ✅ **Email** (recommended)
   - ✅ **Google** (recommended for easy sign-in)
   - ✅ **GitHub** (great for developers)
   - ⚪ Discord, Twitter, etc. (optional)
4. Click "Create Application"

### Step 3: Get Your Keys
1. In your Clerk dashboard, go to **API Keys**
2. Copy the **Publishable Key** (starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`)
3. **DO NOT** copy the Secret Key (that's for backend only)

### Step 4: Configure Environment
1. Open your `.env` file in the `frontend` folder
2. Replace the existing `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` with your key:

```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_key_here
```

### Step 5: Restart Development Server
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

## ✅ Verification

1. Open [http://localhost:5174/](http://localhost:5174/)
2. You should see the FlashAudit app without setup instructions
3. Click "GET STARTED" to test authentication
4. Try signing in with your chosen methods

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Authentication Methods
In your Clerk dashboard, you can enable/disable:
- **Email + Password**: Traditional authentication
- **Magic Links**: Passwordless email authentication
- **Social Providers**: Google, GitHub, Discord, etc.
- **Phone**: SMS-based authentication
- **Multi-factor**: Additional security layer

### Appearance Customization
The authentication UI is already styled to match FlashAudit's design, but you can customize:
1. Go to **Customization** → **Appearance** in Clerk dashboard
2. Upload your logo
3. Adjust colors and themes
4. Preview changes in real-time

### Domain Configuration
For production deployment:
1. Go to **Domains** in Clerk dashboard
2. Add your production domain
3. Update environment variables for production

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Missing Publishable Key" Error
- ✅ Check that your `.env` file has the correct key
- ✅ Restart the development server after changing `.env`
- ✅ Make sure the key starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`

### Authentication Not Working
- ✅ Verify the key is from the correct Clerk application
- ✅ Check browser console for error messages
- ✅ Ensure your domain is configured in Clerk dashboard

### Styling Issues
- ✅ The AuthPage component has custom styling for FlashAudit
- ✅ Check browser developer tools for CSS conflicts
- ✅ Verify the Clerk appearance configuration

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### Development

- ✅ Never commit secret keys to version control
- ✅ Use different applications for dev/staging/production

### Production
- ✅ Use `pk_live_` keys for production
- ✅ Configure proper domains in Clerk dashboard

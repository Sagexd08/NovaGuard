üßµ 5 Critical Smart Contract Vulnerabilities Every Developer Should Know

1/ Reentrancy Attacks üîÑ
The classic vulnerability that drained millions from The DAO. Always use the checks-effects-interactions pattern.

2/ Integer Overflow/Underflow üìä
Before Solidity 0.8.0, arithmetic operations could silently overflow. Always use SafeMath or upgrade to 0.8.0+.

3/ Access Control Issues üîê
Ensure only authorized users can call sensitive functions. Use OpenZeppelin's AccessControl for robust permissions.

4/ Front-Running Attacks üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
MEV bots can see your transactions before they're mined. Consider commit-reveal schemes for sensitive operations.

5/ Oracle Manipulation üì°
Price oracles can be manipulated. Use multiple sources and implement circuit breakers for extreme price movements.
